## Project Description
The project we have chosen to undertake is Toxic Comment Classification. This is a challenge posted by Jigsaw/Conversation AI on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).

## Instructions
Run the code with the whichever command is appropriate to your system:

    python toxic.py
    python3 toxic.py

This will unzip all datasets, and run our implemented analysis.

**Note**: Running this file will require a graphical interface. If you are running on WSL, please install [**Xming**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/), or a similar program.
